class Struct:
  """
  Interface for the structure of a source language.
  Each subclass must implement
    flatten(self) - return a list of words contained in this Struct
    get_pos_embedding(self, embed_dim, params) - return a Struct with values that are torch.Tensors (vectors of length embed_dim)
    map(self, f) - return a Struct, after applying f to each value
    __str__ - must be isomorphic with parser
  Above, params is the list of torch.Tensors given in nmt.configurations under the field 'struct_params'.
  Each Struct subclass must also have some function that parses a string and returns the subclass,
  to be referenced in nmt.configurations under the field 'struct_parser'.
